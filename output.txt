📝 Content: From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Intelligence of machines AI redirects here. For other uses, see and . Part of a series on Approaches Glossary Artificial intelligence ( AI ) is the capability of to perform tasks typically associated with , such as , , , , and . It is a in that develops and studies methods and that enable machines to and use and to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. High-profile include advanced (e.g., ); (used by , , and ); (e.g., , , and ); (e.g., ); and tools (e.g., and ); and play and analysis in (e.g., and ). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its . Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, , , , , , and support for . To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including and , , , and methods based on , , and . AI also draws upon , , , , and other fields. Some companies, such as , and , aim to create (AGI)AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout , followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as . Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when started being used to accelerate neural networks and outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the . In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid in advanced generative AI became known as the . Generative AIs ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised about and , prompting discussions about to ensure and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical . By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with or incomplete information, employing concepts from and . Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion: They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.

Social intelligence , a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human . For example, some are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate . However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual and, more recently, , wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. General intelligence A machine with would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to . Techniques AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above. Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: and . State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. For example, algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called . are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the (the number of places to search) quickly grows to . The result is a search that is or never completes. or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. is used for programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. Local search Illustration of for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the (the height) uses to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a . Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train , through the algorithm. Another type of local search is , which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them, only the fittest to survive each generation. Distributed search processes can coordinate via algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are (inspired by bird ) and (inspired by ). Logic Formal is used for and . Formal logic comes in two main forms: (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses such as and, or, not and implies) and (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses such as Every X is a Y and There are some X s that are Y s).

📝 Content: Soft computing is a set of techniques, including , and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: and AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the fields long-term goals. General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind Main articles: and There is no settled consensus in on whether a machine can have a , and in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. and add that the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on. However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in . Consciousness Main articles: and identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness. The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennetts consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human is easy to explain, human is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like . Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: and Computationalism is the position in the that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers and . Philosopher characterized this position as : The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.

📝 Content: and write: in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult problems approaches to AI were championed by and and went by many names: . . Matteo Wong wrote in : Whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as natural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different methods, now they all use a programming method called deep learning. As a result, their code and approaches have become more similar, and their models are easier to integrate into one another. Jack Clark wrote in : After a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year. Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever, and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at increased from a sporadic usage in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects in 2015. wrote in 1983: Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about. Daniel Crevier wrote that time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfuss comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier. Searle presented this definition of Strong AI in 1999. Searles original formulation was The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states. Strong AI is defined similarly by and : Stong AI the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking).
